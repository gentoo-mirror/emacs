  jasspa-microemacs-20060909-r1.ebuild:
  Simplify logic for xpm USE flag. Block against app-editors/ne since it also
  installs /usr/bin/ne.

  +files/20050505-ncurses.patch, +jasspa-microemacs-20060909-r1.ebuild,
  +files/jasspa-microemacs.desktop, +metadata.xml:
  Copied from Portage tree. New nanoemacs and xpm USE flags. Fixed dependencies
  for modular X. Don't unpack to or install from ${T}. Install binaries only as
  "me" or "ne". Don't install license.txt and build.txt in doc.
