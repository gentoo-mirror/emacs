	VM is a mail reader that runs under XEmacs and GNU Emacs. It was
	written as an alternative to the Emacs RMAIL mail reader. VM is
	highly configurable and easy to use. It supports POP and IMAP for
	mail retrieval, understands MIME, and reads both the standard UNIX
	mailbox format and the BABYL format used by the RMAIL mailer.
